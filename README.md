# Pathology Segmentation Project (MONAI-based)

This repository focuses on medical image segmentation, aiming to implement robust pipelines that eventually benchmark against the **nnU-Net** (the gold standard from DKFZ, Germany).

## 🚀 Future Milestones
- **Level 1:** Structured repository with Docker support.
- **Level 2:** Pre-processing pipelines for WSI (Whole Slide Images).
- **Level 3:** SOTA model implementation and comparison with nnU-Net.

## 🛠️ Environment & Tools
- **Framework:** MONAI, PyTorch
- **Experiment Tracking:** Weights & Biases (WandB)
- **Code Quality:** Ruff, Black (via GitHub Actions)
- **Containerization:** Docker
